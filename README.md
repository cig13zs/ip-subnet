## 💡 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is my data uploaded to any server?
No. Everything executes locally inside your browser memory or extension sandbox. No telemetry, third-party scripts, or API requests are made.

### Can I use the core library in Node.js or JavaScript projects?
Yes! The core engine in `core.js` is exported as a standard Universal Module Definition (UMD), compatible with Node.js `require()`, ES modules, and browser `<script>` tags:

```javascript
const engine = require('./core');
// Use the core functions directly in your project
```
